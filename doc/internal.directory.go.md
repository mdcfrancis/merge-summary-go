# internal/directory.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose:
	This file provides a structure and associated methods to handle common file system operations such as checking for the existence of a directory or creating one if it doesn't exist, as well as writing content to a file within a directory.

## Important parts:
- A `FileTools` struct is defined with a `Directory` as its field, to encapsulate operations related to a directory:
```go
type FileTools struct {
	Directory string
}
```
(Line 8)

- The `CheckOrCreateDirectory` method checks if the `Directory` field of a `FileTools` struct is set and attempts to create the directory if it does not exist. It can create directories recursively if required:
```go
func (f FileTools) CheckOrCreateDirectory() error {
	// ...
}
```
(Line 13)

- The `WriteFile` method writes a file with a given name and content to the directory specified by the `Directory` field of a `FileTools` struct:
```go
func (f FileTools) WriteFile(fileName, summary string) error {
	// ...
}
```
