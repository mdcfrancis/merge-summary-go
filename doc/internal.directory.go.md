# internal/directory.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file defines a Go package providing utilities for directory operations, including checking for the existence of a directory or creating it, and writing files to a directory.
## Important parts: 
- The `FileTools` struct (Lines 8-10) serves as a container for directory-related operations with `Directory` as its sole field.
  ```go
  type FileTools struct {
      Directory string
  }
  ```
- The `CheckOrCreateDirectory` method (Lines 13-20) checks for the existence of the `Directory` within the `FileTools` struct, or creates it if it doesn't exist, including the creation of parent directories if necessary.
  ```go
  func (f FileTools) CheckOrCreateDirectory() error { ... }
  ```
- The `WriteFile` method (Lines 23-27) writes a string to a file within the specified directory contained in the `FileTools` struct. It takes the file name and content as parameters.
  ```go
  func (f FileTools) WriteFile(fileName, summary string) error { ... }
  ```
