# cmd/doc.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose:
This file defines a command for a CLI application that, given a GitHub repository owner and name, clones the repository into memory and generates a summary document for each file within the repository, excluding certain files. Then it creates a `README.md` file with an indexed summary of all processed files in a specified output directory.

## Important parts:
- The variable `docCmd` (line 21) represents the custom 'doc' command built using the `cobra` library. This command defines how to generate summaries by interacting with a GitHub repository.
  
  ```go
  var docCmd = &cobra.Command{...}
  ```
  
- The `Run` function (line 31) encapsulates the command's logic: cloning the repository, iterating over the files in the repository's latest commit excluding any unwanted files, generating summaries, and writing them to the output directory.

  ```go
  Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { ... }
  ```
  
- The `git.Clone` function (line 38) is used for cloning the repository into memory storage:

  ```go
  r, err := git.Clone(memory.NewStorage(), nil, &git.CloneOptions{URL: repo})
  ```
  
- The `CheckOrCreateDirectory` function (line 63) and `WriteFile` function (line 91) from `internal.FileTools` are called to ensure the output directory exists and to write the generated summaries to disk, respectively.
  
  ```go
  err = ft.CheckOrCreateDirectory()
  // ...
  err = ft.WriteFile(fileName, summary)
  ```

- The `init` function (line 101) registers the `docCmd` with the root command of the CLI application and sets up the required flags. The `outputDirectory` variable is bound to the 'output' flag to determine where the summaries should be saved.

  ```go
  func init() { ... }
  ```
