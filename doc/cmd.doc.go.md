# cmd/doc.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
The file defines a command-line command that generates a summary document for a GitHub repository, excluding several common files and any files in hidden directories.

## Important parts: 
- The `docCmd` variable holds the configuration for the `doc` command, which includes the command usage, a short description, and the logic to run the command (Lines 21-78).
    ```go
    var docCmd = &cobra.Command{ ... }
    ```
- The clone operation of the specified repository uses the go-git library (Lines 29-37).
    ```go
    r, err := git.Clone(memory.NewStorage(), nil, &git.CloneOptions{ ... })
    ```
- There's a filter logic to exclude specific files and files in hidden directories when iterating over the repository files (Lines 42-55).
    ```go
    for _, excluded := range excludedFiles { ... }
    ```
- The `FileToSummary` method is used to generate a summary for each file (Line 62).
    ```go
    summary, err := cfg.FileToSummary(internal.Chunk{Content: allLines})
    ```
- The file summaries are prepared and written out, and an index page (README.md) summarizing the repository content is also created (Lines 58-74).
    ```go
    err = ft.WriteFile(fileName, summary)
    ```
- The `init` function is used to set up the command flags and add the `doc` command to the `rootCmd` (Lines 80-85).
    ```go
    func init() { ... }
    ```
