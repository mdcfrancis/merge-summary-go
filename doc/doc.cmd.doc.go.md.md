# cmd/doc.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file orchestrates the generation of documentation for GitHub repositories by analyzing their contents and producing summaries.
## Important parts: 
- The `docCmd` structure defines a Cobra command to handle user input and produce documentation (lines 27-89).
```go
var docCmd = &cobra.Command{
	// ...
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		// ...
	},
}
```
- The cloning of repositories is done through `git.Clone` function, which utilizes in-memory file storage (lines 32-37).
- The code to exclude certain files and directories when generating summaries can be found within a filtering process (lines 50-81).
- `init` function sets up the command-line interface, including the registration of the `docCmd` and the specification of the `outputDirectory` flag (lines 91-95).
```go
func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(docCmd)
	// ...
}
```
