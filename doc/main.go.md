# main.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file serves as the entry point for a Go application, where it invokes a function to execute the application's command-line interface.

## Important parts: 
	The `main` function is critical as it triggers the command execution defined in the `cmd` package.
	```go
	func main() {
	    cmd.Execute()
	}
	```
