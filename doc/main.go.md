## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file serves as the entry point for a Go application, invoking a command execution function.
## Important parts: 
	- The `main` package declaration (line 4) indicates that the file belongs to the main package, which is standard for executable Go programs.
	- Import statement (line 6) includes a package from `com.github/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/cmd` necessary for the `main` function.
	- The `main` function (line 8) is the starting point of the application and calls `cmd.Execute()` to run the command defined in the imported package.
