# main.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file serves as the entry point for a Go application, where it initiates the program's execution by invoking a function defined in an external package.
## Important parts: 
	The `main` function is defined here and is responsible for the execution start. It calls the `Execute` function from an imported package:
	
	```go
	func main() {
		cmd.Execute()
	}
	```
	- Line 7: The `main` function is the only function in this file.
