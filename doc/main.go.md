# main.go
## Language: 
	Go
## Purpose: 
	This file serves as the entry point for a Go application, where it invokes a command execution function.
## Important parts: 
- The `main` function is the entry point and makes a call to `cmd.Execute()`, found at line 7. This suggests that the real logic is handled within the `cmd` package.
```go
func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}
```
