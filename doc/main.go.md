# main.go
## Language: Go (Golang)
## Purpose:
	This file serves as the entry point for a Go application, where it initializes and executes the application's primary functionality.
## Important parts:
	The main function on line 8 is the entry point for the program. Using `cmd.Execute()`, it calls a function (presumably from an imported package) to start the application's operations.

```go
8	func main() {
9	    cmd.Execute()
10	}
```
