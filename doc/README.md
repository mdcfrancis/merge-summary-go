### Brief Summary of the Repository

The repository `merge-summary-go` on GitHub, found at [mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go), is designed to automate the process of creating summarizations for pull request (PR) details and differences (diffs) in GitHub repositories. This automation is achieved using an AI model from the OpenAI API. The primary programming language used in this repository is Go (Golang). It provides features such as structuring PR details, handling diff content, and integrating API calls to generate markdown-formatted summaries that leverage the capabilities of GPT models provided by OpenAI.

**Summary:**
`merger.go` serves as the core of the application, focusing on automating PR detail and diff summary generation for GitHub repositories using OpenAI's AI model. The script includes multiple structs and functions:

- `PRDetail` struct, which defines the PR details structure.
- `Chunk` struct, which holds sections of the diff content.
- `getFromGPT` function, which communicates with the OpenAI API to get a summary from GPT.
- `summarizeSummary` function, which formats the summary into markdown using the AI API.
- `chunkToSummary` function, which transforms diff chunks into AI-powered summarized markdown text.
- `splitDiff` function, which separates the raw diff content into distinct chunks.
- `getDiff` function, which retrieves the diff from a GitHub PR as chunks.
- `getPRDetail` function, which fetches the details of a GitHub PR.
- The `main` function acts as the appâ€™s entry point, where command-line parsing, PR detail retrieval, diff fetching, and summarization using AI API are executed, resulting in a combined summary output.
