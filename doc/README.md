### Brief Summary of the Repository:
The repository `merge-summary-go` hosted on GitHub at `https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go` appears to be a Go language-based tool focused on providing command-line utilities for summarizing GitHub repository content, particularly pull requests (PRs). It uses Cobra for creating CLI commands and interfaces with the OpenAI service to generate summaries for code changes or repository content. Its main capabilities include generating summary documents for repositories and crafting summary messages for pull requests by analyzing their content and changes.

### Individual File Summaries:

##### Type of Change: Command Implementation
- **Purpose:** Implements a command that generates summary documents for repository content, excluding common and hidden files.
- **Main Components:**
  - `docCmd` command configuration.
  - Repository cloning using go-git.
  - Filtering logic for files to include in summary.
  - Summary generation for files via `FileToSummary`.
  - Summary output, including creating an index page.
  - Command flag setup with `init` function.

#### [cmd/message.go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/master/cmd/message.go)

##### Type of Change: Command Implementation
- **Purpose:** Defines a command-line command for summarizing pull request changes into a message.
- **Main Components:**
  - Command configuration with `messageCmd`.
  - Retrieval and summary generation logic within `Run` function.
  - `init` function for adding command to root and flag configuration.

#### [cmd/root.go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/master/cmd/root.go)

##### Type of Change: CLI Root Command Setup
- **Purpose:** Sets up the base command-line interface for summarizing pull requests on GitHub.
- **Main Components:**
  - Base `rootCmd` for the CLI.
  - `Execute` function to run the root command.
  - CLI flag declarations for repository details.

#### [internal/directory.go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/master/internal/directory.go)

##### Type of Change: Utility Functions
- **Purpose:** Provides functionalities for directory operations, such as checking their existence and writing files.
- **Main Components:**
  - `FileTools` struct with directory path.
  - `CheckOrCreateDirectory` method.
  - `WriteFile` method.

#### [internal/library.go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/master/internal/library.go)

##### Type of Change: GitHub Interaction and Summary Generation
- **Purpose:** Acts as a utility library for GitHub interactions and generating summaries with OpenAI.
- **Main Components:**
  - `PRDetail` and `Chunk` struct definitions.
  - `Config` struct with methods for interacting with GitHub and OpenAI.
  - `splitDiff` function for parsing diffs.
  - HTTP request functions for PR details and diffs.

#### [main.go](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/master/main.go)

##### Type of Change: Application Entry Point
- **Purpose:** Serves as the starting point of the Go application, invoking the command execution function.
- **Main Components:**
  - The `main` function calls `cmd.Execute` to kick off the application logic.
