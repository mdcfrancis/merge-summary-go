# Repository https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go
- The repository at https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go is designed for summarizing GitHub pull requests using Go. It contains several Go files and documentation files that work together to facilitate the extraction of PR details and generate summaries with the help of an AI model. The use of the Cobra library for CLI operations is a key component of the repository, which suggests that the repository's functionality is available as a command-line tool.

- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/example.go.md)
- This file contains the main logic for the application.

## `cmd/doc.go`

- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/cmd.doc.go.md)
- The file `cmd/doc.go` is part of a CLI tool and is responsible for generating documentation summaries for files in a git repository. Key operations include cloning a repository, filtering files for processing, generating summaries, and writing them to a README.md file.

## `cmd/message.go`

- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/cmd.message.go.md)
- The `cmd/message.go` file defines a command-line functionality for fetching details from a pull request on GitHub and creating a summarized message based on that information. It encapsulates this logic through Cobra command configurations and associated functions.

## `cmd/root.go`

- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/cmd.root.go.md)
- Serving as the foundation for the command-line application, `cmd/root.go` sets up the base `cobra.Command` and includes configurations for the command-line interface, including execution, definition of global flags, and initialization of the command structure.

## `internal/directory.go`
- [View file in repository](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/directory.go)
- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/internal.directory.go.md)
- The `internal/directory.go` file offers utilities for file system operations within the application, such as checking for directory existence, creating a new directory, and writing files. It is primarily centered around the `FileTools` struct which encapsulates these capabilities.

## `internal/library.go`
- [View file in repository](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/library.go)
- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/internal.library.go.md)
- Aimed at processing and summarizing GitHub pull requests, the `internal/library.go` file is essentially a collection of functions and types that cooperate to fetch PR details, communicate with an AI model to process these details, and generate summaries and markdown indices.

## `main.go`
- [View file in repository](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/main.go)
- [View Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/main.go.md)
- The entry point of the repository's Go application is defined in `main.go`, where the `main` function calls `Execute` to start the command-line tool provided by the package defined in other parts of the repository.
