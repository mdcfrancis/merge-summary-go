### Brief Summary of the Repository
The repository `merge-summary-go` located at https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go appears to be a Go-based application designed to interact with GitHub repositories for the purpose of generating summaries for pull requests and their file changes. It leverages the OpenAI API to produce these summaries, suggesting the use of AI-driven natural language processing capabilities. The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) built with the Cobra library, allowing users to execute commands for generating documentation and summaries of GitHub repositories. The main features include cloning repositories, summarizing file changes (diffs), processing pull request details, and generating markdown formatted outputs.

### Summaries in the Repository

#### File: cmd/doc.go
- **Type of change**: New command definition
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/doc.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/doc.go)**
- **Summary**: The `cmd/doc.go` file defines a CLI command, `docCmd`, that generates a summary document for GitHub repositories by cloning them and processing files to create an index page as README.md. It employs the `go-git` package for in-memory cloning and excludes specific files from the summarization process.

#### File: cmd/message.go
- **Type of change**: New command definition
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/message.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/message.go)**
- **Summary**: The `cmd/message.go` file establishes a command, `messageCmd`, in a CLI application that retrieves and summarizes the differences in a pull request. It involves printing details of the pull request, fetching diffs, and producing a summarized output.

#### File: cmd/root.go
- **Type of change**: Base command setup
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/root.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/cmd/root.go)**
- **Summary**: The `cmd/root.go` file defines the base command for the CLI application, `rootCmd`, and configures command-line flags for various setup parameters like repository owner, repository name, and the GPT API key. The `Execute` function serves as the entry point for running the CLI application.

#### File: merger.go
- **Type of change**: Feature implementation
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/merger.go.md.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/doc/merger.go.md)**
- **Summary**: The `merger.go` file is designed to automate the summarization of pull request details and diff content from GitHub repositories using the OpenAI API. It includes structures for holding PR details and diff chunks, functions interfacing with the AI API for generating summaries, and the programâ€™s entry point which compiles summaries into a final document.

#### File: internal/directory.go
- **Type of change**: Utility development
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/directory.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/directory.go)**
- **Summary**: The file `internal/directory.go` contains utilities for directory operations, such as checking for a directory's existence, creating directories, and writing files with provided content.

#### File: internal/library.go
- **Type of change**: Library functionality
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/library.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/internal/library.go)**
- **Summary**: In `internal/library.go`, GitHub API interactions are provided along with the functionality for splitting diffs into chunks and generating summaries using GPT models. This includes struct definitions, methods for AI-based summarization, and methods to fetch details from GitHub.

#### File: main.go
- **Type of change**: Application entry point
- **[Doc File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/main.go.md)**
- **[File](https://github.com/mdcfrancis/merge-summary-go/blob/main/main.go)**
- **Summary**: The `main.go` file is the entry point of the Go application, where the `main` function invokes `cmd.Execute()` to start the CLI application.
