# cmd/message.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	The file is responsible for defining a CLI command that allows users to obtain and display a summary of changes from a git pull request.
## Important parts: 
	- The declaration of `messageCmd`, which establishes the command within the Cobra framework (line 13):

```go
var messageCmd = &cobra.Command{
	...
}
```

	- The definition of the `Run` method within `messageCmd`, which outlines the procedure for retrieving pull request changes, processing them, and outputting a summary (lines 22-58):

```go
Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	...
}
```

	- The `init` function, which adds the `messageCmd` to the root of the CLI application and configures related command-line flags (lines 60-63):

```go
func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(messageCmd)
	...
}
```
