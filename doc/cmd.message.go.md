# cmd/message.go
## Language: Go
## Purpose: 
	This file defines a command-line command to retrieve and summarize the differences in a Pull Request (PR) from a remote repository.

## Important parts: 
- Declaration of `messageCmd` variable: This is a command that can be added to the CLI application, making use of the `cobra` library. It is defined with usage instructions, a short description as well as a longer one.
	```go
	var messageCmd = &cobra.Command{ /* line 11 */
		/* ... */
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			/* execution logic */
		},
	}
	```
- The `Run` function inside `messageCmd`: This function is executed when the `message` command is invoked. It processes input arguments, fetches PR details, and computes a summary of changes.
	```go
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { /* line 20 */
		/* ... logic ... */
	},
	```
- Initialization function `init`: This is a special function in Go, and it's used to set up the command before the application runs. It attaches the `messageCmd` to the root command and defines a flag for qualitative summarization.
	```go
	func init() { /* line 57 */
		rootCmd.AddCommand(messageCmd)
		messageCmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&qualitative, "qualitative", "q", false, "Use qualitative summarization")
	}
	```
